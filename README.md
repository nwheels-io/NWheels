NWheels is A-to-Z architectural recipe and implementation framework for enterprise applications and data processing systems built on the Microsoft .NET platform.

Introduction
-----

Building an enterprise application with NWheels means following a comprehensive set of field proven patterns and practices, which together comprise robustly architectured solution. The motivation to build NWheels framework is [explained here](http://wesimplify.net/).

NWheels comes equipped with ready solutions to many kinds of common problems faced by the majority of enterprise and data processing applications. Customizable entity model and pluggable business logic, claims-based authorization consistently applied through application layers, support for scalability and fault tolerance on premise and in the cloud, are just a few examples to name. 

Unique features of a concrete application are developed in any .NET-supported language, and on top of NWheels programming model. In addition to exposing infrastructure facilities, the programming model is aimed to:

* Make application code minimalistic, conscise, and expressive
* Abstract application code from any concrete presentation and data storage platforms
* Ensure that the architecture is consistently followed through the entire code base

Besides that, there are no limitations on what application code can do.

NWheels consists of:

* Technology-agnostic Core, which defines architectural concepts, expressed through the programming model.
* A set of technology stack modules, each adapting the Core to a certain set of technology libraries or APIs.
* A set of domain building block modules, which provide adaptable entity models and business logic components for common business domains, such as e-commerce or CRM.

Project Status
-----

There are currently (at least) three commercial software systems being developed on top of NWheels. Of them, two are enterprise applications and one is data processing middleware. All three are planned to be in production by September 2015. We are actively adding features required by these projects.
