# Welcome to NWheels

## How it works

1. You are provided with a DSL for every typical aspect of enterprise application (e.g., UI, DDD, DB, authorization, monitoring, CI/CD, and many more). 

1. You write small amount of code in these DSL. Your code is clean from technology details, and expresses the distilled concept of your application.

1. You pick technology adapters for every aspect involved in your code. For example: UI -> web/React, REST API -> node/Express, DDD -> TypeScript, DB -> MongoDB, Monitoring -> Elastic, and others. You can setup different technology stacks for different components of your application (such as microservices or UI apps).

1. You build the project, and the DSLs get transpiled into production-ready human-maintainable codebase per technology choices you've made. You also get a CI/CD pipeline ready to deploy your application to production.

1. You maintain and enhance the application in the DSL code. You can just scaffold, prototype, or experiment with alternative domain models. But you can also stick to DSL in the long run. That would be a great cost saver and velocity booster for your project.

1. You can eject at any moment: just stop maintaining the DSL code, and start maintaining the generated codebase.
